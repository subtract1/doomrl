function DoomRL.loadweapons()

	--[[German weapons are common.
	  British and American weapons are exotic.
	  Uniques are probably going to be weird things from other Wolf titles.

	  In a game, balance is more important than accuracy.
	  For that reason most fully automatic weapons are weaker than single shot
	  weapons.  Let's just assume that it's a built in 'recoil' penalty.
	  Balance also means that the German weapons get gimped a little bit in
	  favor of the exotics.  Let's say that's because BJ's more familiar with
	  them.  Ammunition is a tricky point here; I'm not so crude as to make all
	  weapons accept 'ammo' or some equally poor substitute, but it's not
	  reasonable to assume a Nazi fortress is going to be loaded with 303s...

	  There are a few ways around this:
	  Make all ammo types spawn at least semi-regularly
	  Try and affect the generator to bias ammo when dropping exotics
	  Treat ammo as rare and spawn 'exotics' with abandon
	  Use special levels to generate guaranteed exotic ammo caches

	  My current design focuses on weapon caches and with weapons being
	  discarded as better models become available.  For this reason biasing the
	  generator and relying on special levels seems a safe bet; you get a bunch
	  of special ammo with the weapon and simply discard it when you run out.

	  Lastly, damage types and armor.  Unfortunately I do not have access to
	  custom damage types nor is it possible to alter the characteristics of
	  the current types.  On top of that the hard truth is percentage based
	  reduction + flat damage reduction simply doesn't work.  Given what I have
	  to work with the best option seems to be discarding flat reduction
	  completely.  This also bypasses the hardcoded armor modifiers.
	    Damage_Bullet	Kurz weapons, equal to mid-range rifles
	    Damage_Melee	Melee of course
	    Damage_Sharpnel	Shotguns and pistol rounds, would prefer two types
	    Damage_Acid	Acid (which is pretty rare)
	    Damage_Fire	Fire + explosions (not quite as rare)
	    Damage_Plasma	Rifle rounds.  The eating through walls is a problem...
	    Damage_SPlasma	Ignored since it ties to plasma defensive-wise
	    Damage_IgnoreArmor	Exactly what it says on the tin
	  Our armor modifiers aren't .5 1 2; with percentages we can be flexible.

	--[[ Tesla Cannon
	  The tesla cannon fires chain lightning.  When it hits
	  an enemy it will search for another nearby enemy and zap it as well.
	  The next target is chosen at random; closer enemies are not selected for
	  in any way.  As a result, since the cannon fires multiple bursts, there's
	  a good chance the lightning will arc differently for each shot.
	
	  Balancing considerations: 
	  Should the player be allowed to aim? (currently yes)
	  Should items or a dead enemy bounce lightning (curently no)
	  What is the range of the lightning? (currently 7 and 5 for the initial shot and the chain)
	  Should the lightning damage decay? (currently yes)
	  Should there be a maximum number of enemies hit? (currently yes, 5)
	  Should the weapon re-hit enemies if there's no one else in range? (currently no)
	
	  Currently I know of no way to actually draw the chained lightning.  I can
	  chain the lightning and damage multiple enemies but it must be done outside of normal
	  enemy damage missile bookkeeping channels.  Explosions are drawn to mark damaged enemies.
