--[[ Some quotes I've picked up that could be useful (Patton quotes are quite good for DoomRL :)
 *A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week. 
 *A pint of sweat will save a gallon of blood.
 *A sucking chest wound is Nature's way of telling you to slow down.
 *All warfare is based on deception.
 *Alright you bastards, try and shoot me!
 *Any excuse to wear a sword is a good excuse.
 *Courage is fear holding on a minute longer. 
 *Few men are killed by the bayonet, many are scared by it. Bayonets should be fixed when the fire fight starts
 *Fixed fortifications are monuments to the stupidity of man.
 *God is not on the side of the big battalions, but on the side of those who shoot best.
 *I should have been delighted had it come to a fight. I felt absolutely sure of myself with a pistol in my hand.
 *If I want your opinion, I'll read it in your entrails.
 *If it's worth fighting for...it's worth fighting dirty for.
 *If the enemy is within range, so are you.
 *Incoming fire has the right of way.
 *It's not the one with your name on it; it's the one addressed "to whom it may concern" you've got to think about.
 *Just drive down that road, until you get blown up
 *Make your plans to fit the circumstances.
 *Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity. 
 *No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.
 *No one ever goes into battle thinking God is on the other side.
 *Peace is that brief glorious moment in history when everybody stands around reloading.
 *The God of War hates those who hesitate.
 *There is only one tactical principle which is not subject to change. It is to use the means at hand to inflict the maximum amount of wound, death, and destruction on the enemy in the minimum amount of time.
 *To halt under fire is folly. To halt under fire and not fire back is suicide.
 *Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men.
 *We're a simple people... but piss us off, and we'll bomb your cities.
 *We're all given some sort of skill in life. Mine just happens to be beating up on people.
 *Well, I'm about as tall as a shotgun, and just as noisy. 
 *Whoever said the pen is mightier then the sword obviously never encountered automatic weapons.
 *You're never beaten until you admit it.
 An army is a team. It lives, eats, sleeps, fights as a team.
 Battles are sometimes won by generals; wars are nearly always won by sergeants and privates.
 Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be utterly lost; 
 Do your damnedest in an ostentatious manner all the time.
 Either war is obsolete or men are.
 Go forward until the last round is fired and the last drop of gas is expended...then go forward on foot!
 Great. Now we can shoot at those bastards from every direction.
 I am a soldier, I fight where I am told, and I win where I fight. 
 I have never advocated war except as a means of peace. 
 I love the smell of Napalm in the morning.
 I want to go where the guns are!
 In war there is no prize for the runner-up.
 It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather we should thank God that such men lived.
 It is war that shapes peace, and armament that shapes war.
 It is well that war is so terrible. We should grow too fond of it. 
 Lead me, follow me, or get out of my way. 
 May God have mercy upon my enemies, because I won't.
 Moral courage is the most valuable and usually the most absent characteristic in men.
 Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. 
 Only the dead have seen the end of the war. 
 Only the dead have seen the end of war.
 Peace Through Superior Firepower
 The art of war is simple enough. Find out where your enemy is. Get at him as soon as you can. Strike him as hard as you can, and keep moving.
 The best weapon against an enemy is another enemy. 
 There is no arguing with him for if his pistol misses fire he simply knocks you down with the butt end of it
 There is no avoiding war; it can only be postponed to the advantage of others. 
 There never was a good war or a bad peace. 
 They are in front of us, behind us, and we are flanked on both sides by an enemy that outnumbers us 29:1. They can't get away from us now!
 Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival.
 War does not determine who is right - only who is left. 
 Wars have never hurt anybody except the people who die. 
 Watch what people are cynical about, and one can often discover what they lack.
 We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender,
 We're surrounded. That simplifies our problem of getting to these people and killing them.
 When you have to kill a man it costs nothing to be polite.
 Where do you put the bayonet?
 You don't hurt 'em if you don't hit 'em
