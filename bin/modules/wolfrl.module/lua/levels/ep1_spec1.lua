--[[ The crypt is just a simple filler level.  Could go anywhere really.
     And since ep1 doesn't really have a theme as far as special levels go
     that makes it a perfect candidate to ease the player in.

     A unique but otherwise weak 'boss' enemy like a mummy might be nice
     if I can find appropriate 'wolf-like' sounds.
